Trees: Is this a Binary Search Tree?
From https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-is-binary-search-tree/problem

Determine if a given binary tree is a binary search tree.

The properties of a binary search tree are:
* The data value of every node in a node's left subtree is less than the data value of that node
* The data value of every node in a node's right subtree is greater than the data value of that node

0 <= data <= 10^4

No input or output, simply return *true* if it is a binary search tree and *false* if not.
